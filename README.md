# Tetris

This is a clone of the popular computer game Tetris by Alexey Pajitnov. Drop pieces made of squares onto the grid and fit them together. Filled rows will be cleared and give points. Clearing multiple rows with one piece will give more points. Try to keep the placed pieces from reaching the top of the grid and get the highest score you can.

## Controls

A: Move piece left

D: Move piece right

S: Move piece down

X: Drop piece

E: Rotate piece

W: Hold piece

R: Restart game
